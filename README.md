# Danbooru Scraper
A Python script that gets links from Danbooru tags and downloads the image

This does include my account and api key in the code, which I know is not a good idea but for the sake of convenience, I'm leaving them in the code

## Dependencies
pybooru: Can be installed with pip

## Future Plans
Improved file name generation
Precompiled binaries
